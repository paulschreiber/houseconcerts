<p>Hi <%= @person.first_name %>,</p>

<p>Yesterday was the 30th -- and final -- NYC Century Bike Tour. The weather cooperated, the peanut butter sandwiches were tasty, and I had a great ride. Now it’s time to remind you about this Saturday’s concert.</p>

<ul class="summary">

<li><%= @show.start_date %> &middot; <%= @show.start_time %></li>

<li>RSVP for location/directions</li>
</ul>

<h2>A bit about <%= @show.name %></h2>

<p>Andrew Kerr was one of the first people to play at my house, way back in 2002. Since then, he's toured, raised a family, started a construction company…and wrote some more good songs.</p>

<p>Sometimes funny, sometimes thoughtful and always a good storyteller, it's great to have Andrew grace my living room.</p>
