<p>Hi <%= @person.first_name %>,</p>

<p>Good news: it's once again summer. More good news: it's time for another house concert. Even better news: it's a Carlos Olmeda house concert!</p>

<p>One of the many great singer-songwriters to emerge for San Diego's coffeehouse scene in the late ’90s, Carlos
spent time writing and playing with Jason Mraz, Jewel and Martin Sexton, among others.</p>

<p>Effortlessly switching between English and Spanish, folk, rock and pop, Carlos both relaxes and energizes you.</p>

<p>Now a Mainer, Carlos will play my first show of 2015. I’m excited to host him — <%= link_to "come join us", @rsvp_url %>.</p>

<p>P.S. If you don’t want to receive any more concert invites, <%= link_to "instantly unsubscribe", @unsub_url %>. Don’t worry, you won’t hurt my feelings.</p>
