<p>Hi <%= @person.first_name %>,</p>

<p>In two days, it will be Canadian Thanksgiving. In two weeks, I’m hosting Canadian singer-songwriter Shawna Caspi. We won’t have turkey and cranberries, but we will have terrific songs and stories.</p>

<h2>A bit about <%= @show.name %></h2>

<p>While Shawna Caspi calls Toronto home, she’s spent much of the last two years on the road in support of her fourth album, <cite>Forest Fire</cite>.</p>

<p>She spent March at a songwriting residency at the Banff Centre for Arts and Creativity. Shawna recently won a silver award in the Mid-Atlantic Song Contest and played at Summerfolk and the Ottawa Grassroots Festival.</p>

<p>When she’s not behind the guitar, Shawna is often behind an easel, creating landscapes of the places she tours.</p>
