<h1>About my house concerts</h1>

<div class="pagetext">
<p>
I started hosting house concerts in Sunnyvale, California in 2002. The series later moved to San Francisco, California and Brooklyn, New York. Over the course of 80 shows, I’ve had the good fortune of having some of my favourite musicians play in my living room.
